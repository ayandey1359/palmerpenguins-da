# Palmer-Penguins Data Analysis - Repository 
palmer-penguins is a extremely popular data set in the Data Science.So I pick up this data set to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) . And I preferred to use R programing language to do it.  

===================================================

This Repository contain:

#### r-code.Rmd : 
In this file I use R markdown format to do EDA.

#### git-code: 
This file contains all the git code which is used during this project.

#### docs: 
This folder contains the HTML format of r-code , the main purpose of this file is to generate a GitHub page.  To understand the project in very tidy manner.
